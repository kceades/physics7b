Material for my Physics 7B GSI Sections

The templates.py and builder.py files together allow for a complete build of the site taking the material from weekfiles and topicfiles folders. Each has a template example in the parent (main) directory to be used with the parser. The data is simplified as much as possible, so hopefully it is not terribly difficult to remember, make changes to or alter.

I may or may not further my autobuilder in the future to make it even better. For now, not enough time in the day.

Another note: this repository links to my old site from Fall 2017. I have a new site (which is basically the same) but it has less material since I post material as we come to it in the semester.
To visit the new site, visit physics7b.atspace.cc
