Material for my Physics 7B GSI Sections

The templates.py and builder.py files together allow for a complete build of the site taking the material from weekfiles and topicfiles folders. Each has a template example in the parent (main) directory to be used with the parser. The data is simplified as much as possible, so hopefully it is not terribly difficult to remember, make changes to or alter.

I may or may not further my autobuilder in the future to make it even better. For now, not enough time in the day.
