\section{Thermal Expansions}

\subsection{Three Dimensions}

You have a rectangular prism that has a length $L_0$, a height $H_0$, and a width $W_0$. First, consider that the thermal expansion of the prism is isotropic (equal in all directions). It has a linear expansion coefficient $\alpha$. What is the volume expansion coefficient of the prism for a small temperature change?

Now consider that the thermal expansion of this prism is anisotropic. Its length expands with linear expansion coefficient $\alpha_L$, and its other dimensions expand with linear expansion coefficient $\alpha_{HW}$. What is the volume expansion coefficient of the prism for a small temperature change?

\subsection{Expanding/contracting holes}

If you heat an annulus of inner radius $a_0$ and outer $b_0$, does the hole get larger or smaller? Why? Can you quantify this change? How? Expalin and justify this (hint: there is more that one way/dimension to think this through in).

\subsection{Becoming an experimenter}

How might you measure the coefficient of either linear or volumetric expansion?
