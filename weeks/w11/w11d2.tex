\subsection{Kirchhoff Practice}

Consider the circuit shown. Suppose the current form A to B is 3 A.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] Find the current through each resistor.
	\item[(b)] Find the voltage V of the battery on the left.
	\item[(c)] Find the power generated by each battery.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Capacitors in a Circuit}

Consider the circuit shown below that contains capacitors $C_1$ and $C_2$ and resistor $R$. Initially the switch is open and the capacitor $C_1$ has charge $Q_0$. The switch is closed at $t=0$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] What is the initial current that flows through the resistor right after the switch is closed?
	\item[(b)] After a very long time, what are the charges $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ on $C_1$ and $C_2$ respectively?
	\item[(c)] What is the charge $Q_2(t)$ on $C_2$ as a function of time?
	\item[(d)] How will $Q_2(t)$ be modified if a dielectric of constant $\epsilon$ is inserted in between the plates of capacitor $C_2$?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{}

Consider a circuit where a battery leads into a resistor $r$, which then splits into parallel resistors $r$ and $R$. If you wanted the power through the resistor $R$ to stay constant even if the resistance $R$ varies slightly, then what value of resistance $r$ should you use for the two other resistors in the circuit?
